Allows you to create duplicate images in the media library.

== Description ==
This plugin allows you to create duplicate images in the media library, rather than having to create a new copy of the image and upload it to WordPress again.

It works by copying the post and its metadata into a totally new file in the media manager. Any changes you make to the new copy of the attachment -- updating the caption or cropping, for example, will only be applied to the new attachment, not to the original.

This is useful if you want to edit or crop an existing image without effecting the original 

To use, go to the Library tab and you will see a copy file link below each media (this will only appear in list view, see faq)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I see the copy file link in the media library? =

You are probably in the grid view in the media library.  To toggle the view from grid to list click the mode button in (usually in the top left hand corner). Then under each item you will see a Copy file link next to view.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `lh-copy-media-file` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
