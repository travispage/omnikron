- candy-admin-simple.css updated - Version: 2.1.0 - 2.1.1

VERSION 1.1.0
- Scripts updated for FitVids.js & Isotope.js
- More re-organization.
	- OPTIONTREE now loads from the core (via [functions.php]).
	- OT Google Fonts now loads from the core (when needed).
		- This ultimately allows us to update OptionTree very easily within core.
	- Layout Variables moved from the old [theme-optiontree-loader.php] to the [theme-layout-variables.php]
- Update all [functions.php] & [theme-layout-variables.php] files in themes to reflect these changes. 
	- [theme-optiontree-loader.php] can be deleted.

- Key Benefits of Core (ie: why am I bothering with this?):
	- Automatically runs an updated version of OptionTree, OT Google Fonts, Visual Composer, and Revolution Slider.
	- Includes the latest OT-Mythology skin & interactive scripts for OptionTree.
	- Loads a base set of stylesheets, functions, and scripts that are handy with all themes.
	- It's modular, so you can determine which parts are used/unused from functions.php

	- DEVELOPER NOTES:

	- To move mythology-core into existing themes:
		- Move the mythology-core folder inside.
		- Add the Core-Loader snippet at the top of your functions.php file.
			- Make sure the theme-options.php and meta-boxes.php files are referenced properly.
		- Remove any references to OptionTree/OT-GoogleFonts/VisualComposer/RevolutionSlider from the theme's TGM Class as these are now auto-loaded.

	- To update existing themes:
		- Move the layout-variables section of [theme-optiontree-loader.php] into [theme-layout-variables.php]
		- Delete [theme-optiontree-loader.php]
		- Update functions.php

>	ROADMAP: 
>	- 1.1.1 will aim to include some white-label skinning options for the admin panels.
>	- 1.1.2 will aim to overhaul the theme documentation with an external "knowledgebase" rather than the internal theme-options notes & PDF docs.


VERSION 1.0.9
- Updated VC + RS

VERSION 1.0.8
- Moving Visual Composer & Revolution Slider to "core plugins" to make them easier to update.
- Updated VC + RS
- Updates to the Theme Options panel skin.
- Making way to allow for "white label" skinning of the options panel (we'll likely release this in 1.1).

VERSION 1.0.7
- Rolling back the TGM Plugin Activation Class (all pre-packaged plugins must be manually installed). The mod from the last version prooved to be unstable.

VERSION 1.0.6
- Added the modified TGM Plugin Activation Class (allowing pre-packaged plugins to also be updated via the class).
- Optiontree updated to 2.4.2

VERSION 1.0.5
- Admin CSS tweaks.
- Optiontree updated to 2.4.1

VERSION 1.0.4
- Now including the OT_Google_Fonts folder. 
- Added style fixes for the Theme UI Builder
- OptionTree updated to 2.4.0
- SOCIAL ICON UPDATES:
	- Removed all social icon PNG files that were not being used regularly.
	- Added in a set of circle social icons.
	- NOTE: We should turn this into a sprite ASAP.
- THEME-CORE: "theme-core/theme-optiontree-loader.php" to include OT_Google_Fonts, although it is disabled by default.
- THEME-CORE: Modified the base ot-theme-options.php header and footer (the options array can stay the same, but I recommend updating the top and bottom). 
	- This ultimately just ensures a smoother loading pattern for OT 2.4 and above.
- THEME-CORE: "theme-core/elements/element-get-social.php" updated to allow for easily toggling the icons family either through a manual variable or a theme option.
- Changes to the OT Candy Skin.

VERSION 1.0.3
- Added skin rules to the numeric-slider handle.

VERSION 1.0.2
- Patched the SF-MENU so that hovering over a dropdown link doesn't also color links in child menus.
- OptionTree updated to 2.3.3

VERSION 1.0.1
- Updating OptionTree to 2.3
- Updated the ot-candy-skin.css file to adapt to OptionTree 2.3 (mostly just overriding button styling)

VERSION 1.0
- original gangsta
